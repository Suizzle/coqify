# Coqify

Coqify is a direct response to Farid Rached’s idea for the Coq Inu hackathon.

Farid would love to see:

“very easily on X who’s $COQ aligned, like me. Using emojis in the name is pretty common, as well as using your pfp. So it needs to be original. What if you could very easily and subtly Coqify your pfp using the famous orange/yellow circle in the coqinu logo, placed around your current pfp?? Subtle, but easily visible.”

Farid specifies a feature:

“I think easiest would be to just be able to paste your twitter url and then in 1 second you can download the upgraded pfp. This also helps to easily create the coqified pfp for someone else.”

Coqify penetrates and satisfies the above requirements via its web app, deployed in under 24 hours for the Coq Inu inaugural hackathon.

## How it works

Enter your Twitter / X username. Select options. Coqify.
